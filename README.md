## 💎 Why I Created This
Managing a global team means constant mental math. "If it's 2 PM for me, is my developer in Singapore sleeping or just starting their day?" 

I built **GlobalSync** to replace mental fatigue with visual intuition. I wanted a tool that feels like a premium cockpit for a global business—where you can "scrub" through time and see the world react in real-time.

## ✨ Elite Features

### 📅 Tactical Planning Mode (AB Testing)
Pause real-time sync and enter a "Planning State." Set a **Primary Clock** (usually your own) and use the **Vertical 24H Slider** or **Direct Hand Interaction** to sweep through the day. Every other clock on the dashboard will instantly calculate its corresponding time range.

### 🌅 Day/Night Visual Awareness
No more accidental midnight calls. Every clock face glows based on local sunlight:
- ☀️ **Golden Glow**: Active working hours (6 AM - 6 PM).
- 🌙 **Deep Blue**: Quiet/Night hours (6 PM - 6 AM).

### 📍 Auto-Geolocation
The app uses IP-based geolocation to instantly detect your city and sets it as the **Primary** reference point the moment you land on the page.

### 🪐 3D Earth Environment
A fully interactive, rotating 3D Earth sits in the background, providing a cinematic sense of scale to your global operations.

### 🔄 Drag-and-Drop Organization
Reorder your clocks based on priority. Keep your most active client or your core development team at the top-left for instant visibility.
